Welcome to ENGG1320! This course combines engineering and business, teaching skills like business models, market analysis, and sustainable innovation.
In Coin Chase, you'll strategize, manage resources, and take risks--just like in real-world engineering projects.
Collect coins, avoid traps, and complete all 5 levels to show your mastery of system design, innovation, and decision-making.
Let's get started!
Remember: yellow stars are regular coins, blue '$' symbols give you extra time, and magenta 'X' marks are traps to avoid!
Round 1: This is the basics. Collect 8 coins within 60 seconds. Use arrow keys to move, spacebar to stop. Watch out for traps!

Round 3: Halfway there! Now you need 14 coins in just 40 seconds. Manage your time and watch for those traps!
Round 4: Almost to the end! 17 coins in 30 seconds. Time is tight, so prioritize those special coins for extra seconds!
