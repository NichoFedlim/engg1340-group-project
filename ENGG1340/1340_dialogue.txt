# Intro dialogues
Welcome to ENGG1340 - Computer Programming II! I'm your professor, and we'll be exploring the fascinating world of C++ today.
In this practical assessment, you'll be defending our codebase against an invasion of "C" language elements trying to corrupt our C++ code.
Your mission is to prevent these "C" spaceships from reaching the left side of the screen by shooting them down with your lasers.
Be careful - the spaceships will fire "+" projectiles at you, and as the challenge increases, they'll drop "O" bombs that rain down from above.
You'll start with 10 HP. Each hit from an enemy spaceship, projectile, or bomb will reduce your health by 1 point. If your HP reaches zero, you fail the course.
Use the arrow keys to move your heart symbol, and press 'F' to fire lasers. Space bar toggles your movement on and off.
The assessment has three increasingly difficult rounds. You must achieve a score of 2000 points in each round to advance.
Are you ready to defend the integrity of C++ against primitive C invasion? Let's begin our programming battle!

# Round info dialogues
Round 1: C Basics. In this round, you'll face basic C spaceships trying to reach your code base. Prevent them from reaching the left edge by shooting them down with your C++ lasers.
Round 2: Pointers and Memory. Now the challenge increases with the addition of memory bombs dropping from above. Watch out for these additional hazards while continuing to fend off the spaceships.
Round 3: Advanced Challenges. The final round features twice as many memory bombs! This represents the most complex memory management challenges in C. Stay focused and don't get overwhelmed!

# Round completion dialogues
Excellent work! You've completed Round 1 with SCORE points. You've demonstrated a good understanding of basic C concepts. But now we'll need to deal with memory management...
Impressive! Round 2 cleared with SCORE points. You've mastered pointers and memory handling. Now prepare for the final challenge with advanced C concepts!
Outstanding! You've conquered Round 3 with SCORE points and proven your mastery over the most challenging aspects of C programming. You're truly ready for advanced C++!

# Game end dialogues
CONGRATULATIONS! You've successfully defended our C++ codebase from all C invasions, scoring a total of SCORE points. Your understanding of both C and C++ principles is excellent - you'll make a fine programmer!
COURSE FAILED! You were only able to reach Round ROUND with a score of SCORE. The C elements have corrupted your code. Better study more memory management and try again next semester!
