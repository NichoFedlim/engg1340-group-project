# Introduction dialogues
Welcome to ENGG1300 -- Fundamental Mechanics! I'm your professor, and today we'll put Newton's laws to the test inside a virtual laboratory.
You control a paddle--think of it as a lightweight girder mounted on frictionless rails. A steel ball represents a concentrated force vector. 
Using only horizontal motion you will redirect that force to demolish a wall of "concept blocks" standing between you and total equilibrium.
Each collision with the paddle is an elastic impact--conserve momentum to aim the force.
Left and right arrow to move the paddle, and space to toggle paddle motion on/off. 
Lives are your safety factor. Lose all of them and the design collapses.
And you will fail this course. 
Let's begin with Round 1. Good luck!

# Round-specific instructions (dialogues 8-10)
Round 1: Half the blocks are missing, mimicking under-loaded trusses. You have five safety factors (lives). Apply forces gently; observe equilibrium and break the remaining members.
Round 2: The entire block lattice is present--full design load. Maintain equilibrium while transmitting sufficient impulse to fracture every element. Five lives again, but the structure won't go down easily.
Round 3: Now we study motion under limited margin: same full lattice, only three lives. Speeds increase, rebounds grow unpredictable--master real-time momentum exchange to finish the job.

# Round completion messages (dialogues 11-13)
Excellent! Your statics are solid; the structure yielded exactly as planned.
Impressive! You proved the entire lattice unstable under your calculated impacts.
Remarkable! You commanded dynamics like a pro and left no block standing!

# Game over messages (dialogues 14-15)
Congratulations! You maintained equilibrium, managed impulses, and mastered both statics and dynamics. Structural integrity certified--move on to tougher systems!
Game over! The structure out-lasted your safety factor. Review free-body diagrams and energy methods, then rebuild next semester!
